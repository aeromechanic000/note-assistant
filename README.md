## Other Projects of Minecraft AI

- [Minecraft AI](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai) : This implementation is extended from the [MINDcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft) framework and is built on Node.js, utilizing the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) API. It provides fast deployment, real-time agent control, and flexible plugin supportâ€”making it especially suitable for live demos, interaction-heavy showcases, and rapid experimentation
- [Minecraft AI-Python](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-python) : This Python-based implementation reimagines the same agent logic in a more research-focused environment. It prioritizes system robustness, fine-grained control, and compatibility with
the Python scientific and AI tooling ecosystem. It is particularly well-suited for educational use, long-term
behavioral analysis, and the development of memory-rich agents
- [Minecraft AI Whitepapers](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-whitepaper) : The place where Minecraft AI whitepapers and technical reports are released.
